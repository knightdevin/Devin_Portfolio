Hi there! Wecome to my portfolio site created by me, Devin Knight.

To run the site locally, run the following commands:

- npm install
- npm run start-dev

The start-dev command should take you to a http://localhost:8080/ where you'll find a landing page and a navbar to peruse various pages. The site is also currently deployed using heroku, and is available to see at https://devin-knight-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to know more about my background or the projects featured on this site. Thank you for visiting!
